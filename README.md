## Overview

This scenario shows how to use Azure Machine Learning Workbench to scale out machine learning algorithms that implement h2o API. We show how to configure and use a remote Docker container and Spark cluster as an execution backend for h2o on Spark.

## Key components needed to run this scenario

* Ubuntu Data Science Virtual Machine. We recommend using a virtual machine with at least 8 cores and 28 Gb of memory.
* Spark HDInsight cluster. We recommend having a cluster with at least 4 worker nodes and at least 28 Gb of memory in each node. 
* Azure storage account.
